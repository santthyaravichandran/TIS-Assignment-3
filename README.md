# TIS-Assignment-3

Academic Writing for Industrial Talk 2

What the assignment was about

This assignment was based on the second industrial talk titled Project Management and System Development. It focused on the speaker’s industry experience, the concepts of project management and system development, and the comparison between Waterfall and Agile methodologies, presented in an academic writing format.

What I learned 

From this talk, I learned that successful software development depends not only on coding but also on proper planning, system design, and management. I gained a clearer understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the differences between Waterfall and Agile approaches, and how project management ensures projects are completed on time, within scope, and within budget.

Skills developed

-Academic writing skills – writing in a formal and structured manner

-Analytical thinking – comparing Waterfall and Agile methodologies

-Conceptual understanding – linking project management concepts to real-world system development

-Critical thinking – reflecting on industry expectations for future IT professionals

Problems faced

One challenge was understanding and explaining technical concepts such as SDLC, Agile sprints, and system architecture in an academic style. Another difficulty was organizing the content logically while maintaining clarity and proper academic tone.

Suggestions for improvement

The talk could be improved by including more real project case studies to demonstrate how Agile and Waterfall are applied in industry. Additional examples of project failures and successes would also help students better understand the importance of project management skills.
